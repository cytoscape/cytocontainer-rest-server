Activated receptors recruit adaptor proteins, which trigger the activation of multiple kinases, ultimately activating transcription factors including interferon regulatory factor3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor kappa- light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB). NF-kB promotes the production of type I interferons (IFN-I), which are released and bind the IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR) expressed on the surface of other cells. This inflammatory response to SARS-CoV infection represents the first line defense against the virus. Coronaviruses interfere with several steps of the immune response, including RNA sensing, type I IFN production and IFN dependent signaling.

Thus, we examined the effect of ORF6 on IRF3 nuclear translocation. Upon poly(I:C) treatment, IRF3 translocated to the cell nucleus in the absence of ORF6, whereas the expression of ORF6 blocked its nuclear translocation (Figure 2D). Karyopherin α 1–6 (KPNA1–6) are importing factors for nuclear translocation of cargos, including IRF3, IRF7, and STAT1 (Chook and Blobel, 2001).
